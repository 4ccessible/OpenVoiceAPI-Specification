# OpenVoiceAPI-Specification

The OpenVoiceAPI Specification serves as a standard for partners to implement accessibility-first interfaces for users of their platforms.

This can also be thought of as an optional and supplemental orchestration layer for preexisting OpenAPI specifications. 

Websites are a great example of visual orchestration where user inputs are their keyboards and mice.

4ccessible is a great example of a voice/audio orchestration implementation where inputs are their voice.

## TODO

- [ ] Identify core partner champions in the BVI community to help identify lowest hanging fruit for partners and flows
- [ ] Develop v1.0.0 schema for low hanging fruit scenarios

## Notes

We are supporting only America for v1.0.0 - there will be large changes needed to support global address (i.e., there are no concepts of "states" in some countries)
